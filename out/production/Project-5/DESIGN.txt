nextPositionDude Entity/WorldModel
Chose WorldModel becasue many of the variables referenced were variables from the
WorldModel Class, meaning I could simplify the code.

removeEntityAt Entity/WorldModel
It literally has Entity in the name, but really it is a worldModel
method because of its references and use within the WorldModel class

addEntity, tryAddEntity Entity/WorldModel
^^see prev. explanation

All the "create___" methods. Entity/WorldModel
I chose to put them in Entity because of the name really. It seemed to make sense
at the time even though I notice they are used almost completely in WorldModel

drawViewport Viewport/VirtualWorld
I choose to put it in viewport because that is the obvious choice. Oh wait
I didn't? Why? I'm not sure, but ended up in WorldView.
